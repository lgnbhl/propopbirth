## Overview

First, TFR (total fertility rate) and MAB (mean age of the mother at birth) forecasts are calculated. In general, the FSO uses the **same model structure** for both forecasts. However, different model types and parameters can be used for the TFR and MAB forecast.

The FSO model for TFR and MAB consists of three time periods



-   **trend** period: in the FSO model usually a few years (one to five years)
-   **temporal** period: the majority of forecast period (FSO: approximately until 2055)
-   **constant** period: end of the for forecast (FSO: until 2075)
